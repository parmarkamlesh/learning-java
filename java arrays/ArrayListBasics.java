public class ArrayListBasics {
/*
The important points about the Java ArrayList class are:
 * Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements. 
 * Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order.
 * Java ArrayList class is non synchronized.
 * Java ArrayList allows random access because the array works on an index basis.
 * In ArrayList, manipulation is a little bit slower than the LinkedList in Java because a lot of shifting needs to occur if any element is removed from the array list.
 * We can not create an array list of the primitive types, such as int, float, char, etc. It is required to use the required wrapper class in such cases. For example:
*/    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /*
         * Contructors
         * ArrayList()
         * ArrayList(Collection<? extends E> c)
         * ArrayList(capacity)
         */

         /*
          * a
          * 
          */
    }
}
